### Welcome to my profile

#### About Me:
Hi, I'm a 21 y/o girl from the West Coast who programs mostly as a hobby. IRL I am an allied health professional. I primarily code in Python and do a lot of work with databases. I enjoy building Discord bots.
On [nationstates.net](https://nationstates.net) I am a Technical Moderator.

- ðŸŽ¶ I'm currently listening to Avril Lavigne
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

#### Some of my projects:

- I am a lead maintainer on [Spyglass](https://github.com/Derpseh/Spyglass), a R/D utility for finding regional update times
- [Bloo](https://github.com/AavHRF/Bloo), a Discord bot to provide verification services for NS discord servers
- [NSLib](https://github.com/AavHRF/nslib), a cool little library that I built mostly for myself because I wanted to learn library design
